# CelestialModel
My ISC 3313 (Scientific Computing) final project. Code uses an RK4/5 ODE to model the movement of planets in the solar system over a defined period of time. All masses and resulting variables are standardized to 1 solar mass.

Figure_0.png contains a plot of the solar system over about 3000 days.

Both inner_planets.png and outer_planets.png contain plots of the solar system over about 100 days.
- gnuplot had some issues that resulted in the text being scrunched.
